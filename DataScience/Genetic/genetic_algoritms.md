## Fitness Techniques

- Give partial credit in the fitness if possible
- The fitness function should return as fast as possible because we're
    going to call it potentially millions of times.

## Glossary

- **Genotype**: is the way the parts of the problem are encoded so
    they can be manipulated by the genetic algorithm
- **Phenotype**: is how the decoded genes are used in solving the
    problem.
- The **fitness function** evaluates the Phenotype in the context of
    the problem being solved to return a fitness value to the
    algorithm.
