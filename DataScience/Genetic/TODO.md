# List TODO

- `[·]` Introduce concurrency
- `[·]` Make two or more branches of genes compete
- `[·]` Compute standard deviation of number of mutations
- `[·]` Get a graph with benchmarks
- `[·]` In knightsProblem:
    - Get formula to initial number of genes
    - Allow add a gene if mutations are greater than standard
        deviation.
    - Add conditional to give up at upper bound of genes allowed
    - Optimize `mutation()`
