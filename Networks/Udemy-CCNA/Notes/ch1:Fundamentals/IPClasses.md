# IP Classes

## Subnet Size

- The bigger the host portion of the network, the more hosts we can
    have
- If the subnet mask is `/8`, we have 24 bits available to allocate to
    hosts, for example
- Unfortunately, when `IPv4` was created, the designers didn't realise
    how big the internet was going to get, and they didn't create a
    big enough address space. The long term solution to this, is
    `IPv6` which has a much bigger address space.
